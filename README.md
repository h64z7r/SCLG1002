2) How does state-sponsored multiculturalism operate to reproduce relationships of power and to disguise ongoing racial and ethnic discrimination?
3) How is police power connected with colonial institutions? You can use any case study (country) to make your point.
4) Metzl states that “‘health’ is a term replete with value judgments, hierarchies, and blind assumptions that speak as much about power and privilege as they do about well-being" (2010, 1-2).
